Imagine your product owner or designer proposes a new feature: a select component where you can choose a person and see their avatar and job title. Let's call it the `PersonSelect` component. It would look something like this:

<Video videoKey="mouse" />

Most people would consider one of the following two options:

1. Using a Prebuilt Component.
2. Build the Component from scratch.

Both options have their own set of challenges.

### Using a Prebuilt Component

Let‚Äôs start by discussing the first option, **using a Prebuilt Component**.

When I‚Äôm talking about a Prebuilt Component, I‚Äôm referring to either a larger component library with various components, like Material UI, or a library/package specifically built to solve a certain problem, like [`react-select`](https://react-select.com/).

Most Prebuilt Components allow customization through themes, configuration files, or changing CSS. But if you're like me, you often struggle with the embedded styling of Prebuilt Components.

I often find myself overriding styles with hacky solutions or dealing with missing features in the prebuilt component. I want to create the best experience possible for our use case, but the prebuilt component holds me back.

<aside>
  üëâ Most times, it‚Äôs not a good sign when you battle with a package. Packages should save time and effort, not increase
  it.
</aside>

If we try to build the `PersonSelect` component with Material UI, we might end up with something like this:

<Video videoKey="material" />

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Select, SelectChangeEvent, MenuItem, Avatar, Box } from "@mui/material";
import { styled } from "@mui/material/styles";
import { people } from "./data";

export const CustomSelect = styled(Select<(typeof people)[0]>)(({ theme }) => ({
  fontSize: "0.875rem",
  width: "min(40ch, 100%)",

  "& .MuiInputBase-input": {
    borderRadius: 6,
    backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.paper,
    padding: "0.375rem 0.75rem",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "0.375rem",
  },
  "& .MuiSelect-icon": {
    display: "none",
  },
}));

export const ListboxMaterial = () => {
  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0]);

  const handleOnChange = (event: SelectChangeEvent<(typeof people)[number]>) => {
    const {
      target: { value },
    } = event;

    // On autofill we get a stringified value.
    if (typeof value === "string") return;

    setSelectedPerson(value);
  };

  return (
    <CustomSelect value={selectedPerson} onChange={handleOnChange}>
      {people.map((person) => (
        <MenuItem
          key={person.id}
          id={person.id}
          value={person}
          sx={{
            gap: "0.375rem",
            fontSize: "0.875rem",
          }}
        >
          <Avatar
            sx={{
              marginInlineStart: "-0.25rem",
              width: "2em",
              height: "2em",
            }}
            src={`https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/open-peeps/svg?seed=${person.name}`}
          />
          <span className="name">{person.name}</span>
          <Box
            component="span"
            sx={{
              marginInlineStart: "auto",
              color: (theme) => theme.palette.text.secondary,
              overflow: "hidden",
              textOverflow: "ellipsis",
            }}
          >
            {person.jobTitle}
          </Box>
        </MenuItem>
      ))}
    </CustomSelect>
  );
};
```

This looks acceptable to me, but the designer probably won‚Äôt be happy. You can still recognise Material UI, especially the signature ripple effect indicating a user press. We could try to remove these things, but again, we‚Äôd be working against the library.

<aside>
  üëâ Depending on the type of application you are building, not having full control over the styling might be
  beneficial. For company internal applications or proofs of concept, prebuilt libraries can be great. However, for
  public-facing applications, you probably want more control.
</aside>

The good thing is the component works as expected, and we didn‚Äôt have to do much to get this functionality. We only modified some styling and kept track of the selected person, which is the stuff we want control over.

But we still have another option to consider.

### Building from Scratch

Alright, next we can explore building the `PersonSelect` component from scratch. I already know that the native [`select`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element [falls short in terms of styling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895476/how-do-i-style-a-select-dropdown-with-only-css), so we will need to create something custom. How hard can it be?

Looking at the component we need to:

- Show the currently selected option.
- Toggle the options list when clicking on the currently selected option.
- Be able to select another op

Here is what that might look like:

<Video videoKey="from-scratch" />

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { people } from "./data";

export const FromScratch = () => {
  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0]);
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleToggle = () => {
    setIsOpen(!isOpen);
  };

  const handleSelect = (person: (typeof people)[number]) => {
    setSelectedPerson(person);
    setIsOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <div className="listbox-wrapper">
      <button className="listbox-value outline" onClick={handleToggle}>
        <img
          className="avatar"
          role="presentation"
          src={`https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/open-peeps/svg?seed=${selectedPerson.name}`}
        />
        <span className="name">{selectedPerson.name}</span>
        <span className="job-title">{selectedPerson.jobTitle}</span>
      </button>
      {isOpen && (
        <div className="listbox-options">
          {people.map((person) => (
            <button
              key={person.id}
              className="listbox-option outline"
              data-selected={person.id === selectedPerson.id || undefined}
              onClick={() => handleSelect(person)}
            >
              <img
                className="avatar"
                role="presentation"
                src={`https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/open-peeps/svg?seed=${person.name}`}
              />
              <span className="name">{person.name}</span>
              <span className="job-title">{person.jobTitle}</span>
            </button>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Pretty neat, right? LGTM. Let‚Äôs ship it!

Not so fast! This component has several issues. It attempts to mimic the native `select` element with custom styling but lacks essential functionality:

- **Keyboard interaction.** In a native `select`, you can navigate between options using the arrow keys and type to select an option. Our component doesn't support this.
- **Focus management.** Options in a native `select` close automatically when focus shifts away. Our component doesn't manage focus at all.
- **ARIA and screen reader support.** A native `select` element has built-in screen reader support. Our component looks like a select, but it doesn't indicate anywhere in the code that it is a select, affecting accessibility.
- **Collision-aware positioning.** A native `select` adjusts its position based on available screen space, opening above or below the selected options as needed. Our component doesn't handle this positioning.

Here you can see me trying to click away to close or use the arrow keys to navigate the options. This doesn‚Äôt work. Then, when I try to tab away, I start cycling through the options.

<Video videoKey="nightmare-2" />

We can try to address all these problems but we would end up with a LOT more code. This component will become a headache to test and maintain.

Building good interaction is really challenging. Users expect a lot from your components, and you need to accommodate a diverse range of users with different preferences and accessibility needs.

Lately I've been using a different approach.

# Headless UI

"Headless" in this context means without overhead. Although the term Headless UI has been around for some time, it's now gaining popularity, with an increasing number of libraries adopting this approach. Most notably, the similarly named [`@headless-ui/react`](https://headlessui.com/) from Tailwind Labs.

<Image
  src="/images/npm-trends-headless-ui.png"
  alt="Comparing headless UI libraries on NPM Trends"

**So, _what is it?_**

It‚Äôs _‚ÄúBring your own UI‚Äù_ <sup>[[1]](#sources-1)</sup>. It‚Äôs _‚Äúunstyled primitive components‚Äù_ <sup>[[2]](#sources-2)</sup>.

The key distinction from Prebuilt Components and Component Libraries, is that Headless UI provides the building blocks to create your own components. You have complete control over the design and, sometimes, even the HTML structure.

_‚ÄúWhat does it even do, then?‚Äù_ you might ask.

Well, it kinda depends on the library. But the main themes are:

- Common interaction patterns.
- Cross browser and device compatibility.
- Other.

Let‚Äôs dive into those.

## Common Interaction Patterns

The web support plenty of interaction patterns. For example, a button to press or an input element for entering text.

Headless UI libraries can offer new interaction patterns that the web platform doesn't provide.

An example of a new component is the Combobox. A Combobox combines an input element and a select element, letting users search through options and select one or more. This component is not provided by browsers in any way. People have come to expect this pattern when dealing with large datasets and long lists of options. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has described the [Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) in detail.

Headless UI libraries can also improve existing patterns that are currently not flexible enough.

A good example of an improved component is the Select (also called Listbox) component. This component aims to replace the native select element, which is [famously difficult to style](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895476/how-do-i-style-a-select-dropdown-with-only-css), giving you full control over the styling.

Most Headless UI libraries come with support for comboboxes and listboxes.

<aside>
  üëâÔ∏è There is [some great work](https://open-ui.org/components/selectlist/) being done by the Open UI community on
  breaking down the best way to make a more extensible select element. But in the meantime, if we want to style a
  select, we need to implement it ourselves.
</aside>

### Building the `PersonSelect` component.

Alright, so what happens when we try to build the `PersonSelect` component again, but now with `@headless-ui/react`?

Loading the library and setting up the select (listbox) looks like this:

<Video videoKey="unstyled" />

There is no styling! This might not be surprising given the title of this blog post, but think of the possibilities. We don't need to use hacky methods to override the default styling of a component because we have complete control over every HTML element and every line of CSS. For now, we can simply reuse the styles from the ‚Äúbuild from scratch‚Äù example.

<Video videoKey="mouse" />

import { Listbox, ListboxButton, ListboxOption, ListboxOptions } from "@headlessui/react";
import { useState } from "react";
import { people } from "./data";

import "./listbox.headless.css";

export const Headless = () => {
  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0]);

  return (
    <Listbox value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>
      <ListboxButton className="listbox-button outline">
        <img
          className="avatar"
          role="presentation"
          src={`https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/open-peeps/svg?seed=${selectedPerson.name}`}
        />
        <span className="name">{selectedPerson.name}</span>
        <span className="job-title">{selectedPerson.jobTitle}</span>
      </ListboxButton>
      <ListboxOptions transition unmount={false} anchor={{ to: "bottom", gap: 4 }} className="listbox-options outline">
        {people.map((person) => (
          <ListboxOption key={person.id} value={person} className="listbox-option">
            <img
              className="avatar"
              role="presentation"
              src={`https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/open-peeps/svg?seed=${person.name}`}
            />
            <span className="name">{person.name}</span>
            <span className="job-title">{person.jobTitle}</span>
          </ListboxOption>
        ))}
      </ListboxOptions>
    </Listbox>
  );
};
```

Looking at the code, the end result is pretty similar to the ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù example. We focus mainly on UI elements and keeping track of the selected person. The component remains super readable, but we also gain some additional features.

### **Keyboard interactions**

Using the arrow keys, we can navigate through the options. Using enter, we can select a new option. Escape closes the select and refocuses the `ListboxButton` element.

We can even start searching through the options by typing the first character(s) of an option.

### **Focus management**

There are two focusable areas in this component. First, we have the `ListboxButton` element, which is always visible.

Next, we have the `ListboxOptions` element, which becomes focused upon opening the select. Even when the `ListboxOptions` element is not close to the `ListboxButton` element in the DOM structure, the individual `ListboxOption` elements are not focusable because we can navigate through them using the arrow keys. When the user selects an option, the focus is restored to the `ListboxButton` element.

<Video videoKey="keyboard-navigation-and-focus-management" />

### **ARIA**

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) declarations are added, following the [listbox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/). This helps screen readers understand and describe the interactive elements on the screen, making the content more accessible to all users.

<aside>
üëâ While these libraries help with describing the component using ARIA roles, ensure that custom solutions maintain correct ARIA roles. *‚ÄúNo ARIA is better than bad ARIA‚Äù.* <sup>[[3]](#sources-3)</sup>

</aside>

### Positioning

The default position for the options list is below the currently selected option. If we scroll so the UI element is at the bottom and try to open the options, they are shown above the currently selected option.

<Video videoKey="collision-aware-positioning" />

These are the kinds of features that take time to implement correctly, but they are also what makes a UI great instead of just good.

Now, onto the next point Headless UI libraries can help us with.

## Cross browser and device compatibility

The web can be accessed almost anywhere‚Äîdifferent browsers, render engines, devices, and interaction methods.

Our web apps need to function everywhere, preferably with a great experience. Headless UI libraries can help create seamless experiences across different browsers and devices.

I‚Äôll give an example using a simple button. Let‚Äôs say we have an outlined button that inverts its colors when hovered over with a mouse.

<Video videoKey="button-hover" />

<Disclosure>
<DisclosureButton>
This is quite easy to do with the `:hover` CSS attribute.
</DisclosureButton>
<DisclosurePanel>

```css
.button {
  /* Simplified for example */

  color: #326bfb;
  background: transparent;
  border: 1px solid #326bfb;
}

.button:hover {
  color: white;
  background: #326bfb;
}
```

</DisclosurePanel>
</Disclosure>

It looks good, so let's ship it. But wait, let's test it on a mobile device first.

When testing on a real mobile device (not just shrinking the viewport), we might see some strange behaviour we didn't expect. The button goes to its hovered state...

‚Ä¶ video here

The web was originally designed around mouse events. When touch devices emerged, browsers added support for touch events but also needed to emulate mouse events to maintain compatibility with existing web apps.

Some Headless UI libraries offer (opinionated) solutions for handling things like hover and focus states making it easier to implement consistent and accessible UI interactions.

<aside>
üëâ For more information on this subject, I highly recommend this blog series about [building a button](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/blog/building-a-button-part-1.html), which perfectly demonstrates the challenges of creating a seamless experience across different browsers and devices.

</aside>

Although it‚Äôs not immediately visible, we do benefit from these features with our Headless UI implementation of the `PersonSelect` component. We get:

- No unintended hover styles on mobile.
- Beter ‚Äúpressed‚Äù states.

Finally, let‚Äôs take a look at some other ways we can benefit from this Headless UI pattern.

## Other

For lack of a better name, I‚Äôve categorised these into the ‚Äúother‚Äù category. These patterns provide functionality but allow you to keep control over styling and html structure.

### **Data grids**

Mostly used in administrative systems, these can become fairly complex. With functionality like sorting, filtering, pinning columns, grouping columns etc‚Ä¶

<aside>
üëâ I really recommend [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/introduction) for this and encourage you to read their motivation/introduction, which also offers a great explanation of headless UI.

</aside>

### **Transitions and Animations**

While CSS can handle this, there are cases where its functionality falls short, such as creating an ‚Äúexit animation‚Äù before a component is unmounted.

From here, we enter the territory of just functionality. Headless UI makes sense if the library is aimed at providing building blocks for the developer.

## Conclusion

Building good interactions is challenging. Users expect a lot from your components, and you need to accommodate a diverse range of users with different preferences and accessibility needs.

So the next time a Product Owner asks you to build a complex component, consider to use a Headless component library.
