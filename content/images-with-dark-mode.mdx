When making this blog, I wanted to respect the color scheme selected by the visitor. Luckily CSS makes this quite easy via the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. But then, when I was writing the post about [React Server Components](/blog/react-server-components), I noticed that light themed images where pretty harsh in dark mode.

<Image
  className="rounded"
  src="/images/harsh-image.png"
  alt="Harsh image in dark mode"
  priority
  width={2216}
  height={1338}
/>

There are a couple of tricks that I could use to make the images less harsh, like adding `filter: brightness(0.5)` to the image for example. But that felt like an afterthought. I am in control of the images here, so I could easily make two variants of the same image. One for light mode and one for dark mode.

## The source tag

Now I'm not the first one to think of this, so a quick chat with Github Copilot resulted in the following code.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-dark.jpg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
  <img src="image-light.jpg" alt="Description of the image" />
</picture>
```

This will automaticly switch the source of the image based on the preferred color scheme. No javascript required. Cool stuff.

### About server side rendering

There is not Javascript logic for our current implementation, this means SSR is supported out-of-the-box.

The source can only be swapped based on a media query, not based on a class or data-attribute like `[data-theme="dark"]` or something.
This means SSR is supported out-of-the-box.

Implementing a theme toggle would require some .

## Further optimization

When a user has a bad connection, loading a image will look like this.

.. movie of loading image ..

There are a couple of things we can improve this, I chose the following:

1. Preventing the layout shift.
2. Adding a blurred preview.

### Preventing the layout shift.

Because I am in control of the images, I know the width and height of the images. If I simply add the `width` and `height` to the `img` tag I can prevent the layout shift.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-dark.jpg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
  <img src="image-light.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="1600" height="900" />
</picture>
```

Now the image will always render with a 16 / 9 aspect ratio and the layout shift will be gone.

.. movie of loading without layout shift ..

### Blurred previews.

So we prevented the layout shift, but we still see a large empty space while the image is loading. A popular pattern for this is to show a blurred preview of the image.
