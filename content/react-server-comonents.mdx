Server Components themself are actually surprisingly easy to understand. Server Components, as the name implies, are React Components that execute their code exclusively on a server. But Server Components are not the only part to this equation. The interesting stuff – and to be fair, also the complex and confusing stuff – comes when we start intertwining server component with regular react components. The React components as we know them right now have a new name, "Client Components".

I'll say up front. Server Components are definitively not for everybody, and before we dive in I'm going to assume you have a basic understanding of the web and React. Before we dive into how server components work we have to understand a bit of context

## A time before React.

Before we had React, SPAs (Single Page Applications) and React Meta-frameworks, HTML was mostly rendered on a server. Say someone wanted to visit a website like this one:

![Picture of ecommerce website selling keyboards.](./keyboards-1-light.jpg?blurhash&darkmode&size=wide)

They would click on a link in Google and the browser would fire an HTTP request to fetch the HTML document. Next, the request is handled by a server which would generate a HTML document and sent it over to the person who requested it. A HTML document is per definition a static document.

The document would roughly look something like this:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <header>...</header>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Keyboards and Keycaps (31)</h1>
      <div class="product-item">
        <img src="/images/gmk-cyl-oblivion-v3-1.jpg" />
        <h3>GMK CYL Oblivion V3.1</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="product-item">
        <img src="/images/gmk-cyl-vamp.jpg" />
        <h3>GMK CYL Vamp</h3>
      </div>
      etc...
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the the network tab would look something like this:

Let's say we want to add a slider on the page so we can view multiple images per product. We could try to achieve this with pure html links and some code on the server. But every time a user clicks on a link, a new document has to be generated on the server and the user will have to wait.

.. movie file of this ..

A better user experience would be to make the page interactive. This allows us to navigate through different images without having to wait on a server. JavaScript to the rescue! With javascript we can modify the html document and make it respond to user interactions. (but you already know this)

We modify a couple of things in the document returned by the server so we have some additional data.

```html
<div class="product-item-slider">
  <img src="/img1" />
  <img src="/img2" />
  <img src="/img3" />
</div>
```

And next, add some JS that will use that additional data.

```js
<script>...</script>
```

And boom! We have a working slider. Now this is a much smoother experience.

.. movie file of this ..

Let's recap what we have:

- A server written in PHP. We use the PHP syntax to dynamically generate a HTML file.
- Some JavaScript that runs in the browser of the person visiting the site. This makes the site interactive.

Now this works great for a simple example like this – although a slider is probably more complex than you might think. But when the web became more and more capable, the sites and apps on it were also getting more complex and interactive. Heck I'm even writing this article in a web-app. And thats when things started to evolve.

## This Rise of React and Single Page Applications (SPAs)

Managing complex web applications was getting harder and harder. If you had to modify stuff in the DOM, you had to select an element and replace it with some other element. Asynchronous operations made this even harder. The shape of the html document was the data source. JS operated on the document.

The rise of frontend frameworks like Angular, Vue and React shifted the way we write our frontend. They were capable of rendering entire pieces of HTML based on data. If data changed, the framework would automatically update the DOM for you. No more manually selecting HTML elements, no more out of sync HTML elements. The declarative nature of these frameworks made sense. And if you wrote UI in them once, you never wanted to go back.

People started writing pieces of a web app in React. Eventually entire applications were written in React. Even handeling routing on the client. This marks the rise of the SPA (Single Page Application) and CSR (Client Side Rendering).

So let's go back to our site. Say we made it a SPA with something like create-react-app. We would have an awesome developer experience, writing our entire application in React. But when someone visits our site right now, they would get a HTML document that looks something like this:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

There is almost nothing in this document. After getting this document (which is very quick because the server doesn't have to do anything) the browser fetches the JavaScript file. The JavaScript file contains all the code to render the UI entire application. Every route, every page. Critically, it does not include the actual data that we want to display. It will only contain instructions on how to render the UI based on different data as an input. But it will first have to get the data.

The network request will look something like this:

.. plaatje of network request ..

Great! We now have an application built entirely in React. The code is declarative, we describe all states of the UI, we tell it where to fetch the data it needs, how to render it and React handles DOM updates for us.

This is still a model that is widely being used, and it's awesome. It is easy to understand. There is a clear separation between backend and frontend. SPAs have a lot of things going for it.

But there are are also a couple of drawbacks:

- There is nothing on the users screen until all of the JavaScript finished running. (and when there is an error, the user will just see a white screen for eternity)
- Search engines don't know anything about the page. (currently they can parse and execute js, but it's not ideal)
- All JavaScript is sent to the client.

I feel like SPA's are a great developer experience. But just like we wanted the best user experience for the slider we've essentially now made the user experience worse.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Hydration

The problems created by moving everyting to CSR and SPAs were solved by frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby both in their own ways.

- Gatsby's solution: heavily focussing on infrequently changing data like blogs, Gatsby pre-rendered different routes based to .html files. Those could be served as static files to a user and contained actual data. From there the entire pages gets taken over by React, this is the hydration process. After hydration the app will function as an SPA with client side routing.
- Next.js solution: use a Node.js server to generate an initial page. You could use `getServerSideProps` to fetch the initial data needed to render any page. This would be sent to the client. From there the entire pages gets taken over by React, this is the hydration process. After hydration the app will function as an SPA with client side routing.

In the mean time Gatsby has also impelmented server-side rendering and Next.js does also have static generation. But the main thing still stands:
These frameworks can per-render a page with some initial data. After sending this to the client the page gets hydrated and after this the JavaScript takes over and the app will function as an SPA with client side routing.

This solves all some of the drawbacks previously mentioned:

- Nothing on the screen -> Yup, we now have an initial html page.
- Search engines don't know anything -> Also not true anymore since the html page contains actual data.
- All javascript is sent to the client. -> Not solved, but frameworks are utilising bundle splitting on a route level so they do not have to sent all JavaScript at once.

Okay, so when we update our site again and implement SSR, the network request will look something like:

.. plaatje of network request ..

Yes! We have a good user experience and we are using React to describe our UI, everybody wins.

If only..

## What are Server Components trying to solve?

In pursuit of the optimal user experience we still have a couple of things we could improve.

### Problem 1 - All JavaScript is sent to the client.

We are using React to describe our components, but not every component is highly interactive. Say we have a component like this:

```jsx
export const Product = (props) => (
  <a href={props.url}>
    <h2>{props.title}</h2>
    <p>{props.description}</p>
  </a>
);
```

Yes this is JavaScript but the component is always static. It has some slots where we can render dynamic data, but output – as far as React is concerned – is always the same. While this is a simple example, another example might make more sense:

```jsx
import CodeHighlighter from "expensive-library";

export const HighlightJSX = (props) => (
  <CodeHighlighter code={props.code} language="jsx" />
);
```

There is probably a lot of javascript needed to calculate the code highlighting. But the output remains static. There is no user interactivity. Basically we are sending unnecessary javascript to the client.

### Problem 2 - SSR happens only once.

Traditionally in the SSR approach, data is only fetched on the server once. On a route level you can determine which data to fetch. Let's say we add dynamic filters to our application

.. foto of site with filters ..

but the fetching of these filters takes some time. We are delaying the initial response because we are waiting for these filters to come in.

One solution we could try is to sent the initial product data for this page, and don't send the filters yet. Then the steps are as follows:

- Fetch product data on the server side
- Send the HTML document to the client
- Hydrate the document
- Fetch filter data
- Render filters

There are a lot of steps happening before we start to fetch the filters. Which actually makes the time from going to the page and actually seeing the filters even longer.

> It's good to mention frameworks are also trying to solve this, Remix solved this using a `defer` function in their loader functions.

### Problem 3 - Data ownership and waterfalls

The rise of frontend frameworks also has something else going for it. Components! Components have been a major part in frontend development for the last years. The pattern makes sense. But, working with data in components has always been a bit of a struggle. There is a lot of stuff happening when we fetch data.

REST apis are great for API developers. Simple and clean endpoints. But most of the time, they are not great for frontends. We've seen things like GraphQL and the Backend for Frontends (BFF) pattern trying to solve this issue. Let's optimize the data we sent to the frontend to just the data the frontend needs. Do the heavy lifting on the server side.

> From a network perspective it also makes sense to narrow down the data as close to the data source as possible. The less bytes have to be sent across the world the better.

Let's take a look at our website example again. In a real world scenario we would probably have some API that serves the products and filters, that API probably returns every property a product might have. The response would be something like:

```json
{
  "productName": "Product 1",
  "description": "A super long description…",
  … +200 lines
}
```

That's a lot of data. Probably not something the frontend needs.

SSR can solve this in some parts, but as we saw we had to shift to the client for fetching the filters.

Another part to this problem is waterfalls. This can easily happen when a component is only conditionally rendered.

Say we have a product page that renders a skeleton when the product is not loaded yet.

```jsx
export const Product = ({ id }) => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useData(`/product/${id}`); // <- This hook will fetch the products asynchronously and will update the state when products are loaded.

  if (isLoading) {
    return <ProductSkeleton />;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Product JSX */} <ProductStock id={id} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

The product stock component also has a network call to fetch the stock. But because the product stock component will only be rendered once the product data is loaded, the network request will be delayed.

.. plaatje van network tab ..

Let's recap.

We now know a little about how and why we got to server components. Specific problems lead to specific solutions. But with Server Components the React team took a step back and looked at the current state of the web and thought of a solution that fit more needs.

> From the RFC: The fundamental challenge was that React apps were client-centric and weren't taking sufficient advantage of the server. If we could allow developers to easily leverage their server more, we could solve all of these challenges and provide a more powerful approach to building apps, small or large.

In the end, React is and remains a UI library. But with Server Components to toolkit we have when building a great UI has expanded.

## Okay.. and Next?

Yes, exactly! Now that we know have some context we can dive in how we can actually use Server Components. Let's take a look at a simple example of a Server Component:

```jsx
export const Product = async ({ id }) => {
  const product = await getProductById(id);

  return <div>{/* Product JSX */}</div>;
};
```

If you have been writing React components for some time you know that this is actually not a valid component. We cannot await stuff in a component. Well, now you can! In a Server Components.

Server components have a couple of rules:

- May not use state, because they execute (conceptually) only once per request, on the server. So `useState()` and `useReducer()` are not supported.
- May not use rendering lifecycle (effects). So `useEffect()` and `useLayoutEffect()` are not supported.
- May not use browser-only APIs such as the DOM (unless you polyfill them on the server).
- May not use custom hooks that depend on state or effects, or utility functions that depend on browser-only APIs.
- May use `async / await` with server-only data sources such as databases, internal (micro)services, filesystems, etc.
- May render other Server Components, native elements (div, span, etc), or Client Components.

### Streaming with suspense

An important part that's making this stuff work is React Suspense, a feature released in React 18. With suspense we can pass asynchronous components

## "use client" and the Client Boundary

I think one of the most controversial pieces of React Server Components is the `"use client"` directive. But once you've been working with this new paradigm for a while it becomes quite intuitive. There is some more splitting of files because of this which is a bit annoying, (Says even Dan) but the benefits you get make it worth it.

The `"use client"` directive marks the server/client boundary. This should be the exact file that introduces some sort of interactivity. A piece of state, an event handler or a useEffect hook. It makes sense because a user can't click on something when the file is still on the server.

A file which specifies a client component can't import a server component anymore. Because we already crossed the boundary to the client. Any other component that's imported from a client component is treated a client component. There is also no need to use the use client directive anymore here. We are already on the client.

```jsx
"use client";

import Tags from "@/components/tags"; // <- this import is treated as client components.
import Image from "@/components/image"; // <- this import is treated as client components.

const Article = (props) => {
  return (
    <article>
      <Image src={props.image} />
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <Tags tags={props.tags} />
    </article>
  );
};
```

The rules of client components:

- May not import Server Components or call server hooks/utilities, because those only work on the server.
- May not use server-only data sources.
- May use state.
- May use effects.
- May use browser-only APIs.
- May use custom hooks and utilities that use state, effects or browser-only APIs.

## Shared Components

In addition to components that can only run on the server and components that can only run on the client, we also have components that meet all constraints of both server and client components. These components can be shared across the server and the client.

The rules of shared components

- May not use state.
- May not use rendering lifecycle hooks such as effects.
- May not use browser-only APIs.
  - May not use custom hooks or utilities that depend on state, effects, or browser APIs.
- May not use server-side data sources.
- May not render Server Components or use server hooks.
- May be used on the server and client.

So a example of a shared component might look something like:

```jsx
import Tags from "@/components/tags";
import Image from "@/components/image";

const Article = (props) => {
  return (
    <article>
      <Image src={props.image} />
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <Tags tags={props.tags} />
    </article>
  );
};
```

#### Wait, isn't this the exact component as before?

Yep! We didn't add any interactivity in the component, so there was no need to mark it as a client component. And because it follows all the rules of a shared component we can now import it anywhere in our app. Server or client.

## Server Components as children

After reading all these rules, you may think a tree of React components like this doesn't make sense.

![](./tree-server-component-child.svg?inline)

But this is actually a valid tree. And it's because Server Components can be passed to Client Components as children.

Say we have a client component like this:

```jsx
"use client";

const Counter = (props) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count</button>
      <div>Current count is: {count}</div>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component doesn't know anything about its children. These will just be passed on via props. Therefore we can also pass Server Components as children.

If we were to try and import a Server Component here we would get an error. This is because we are breaching one of the rules of Client Components.

```jsx
"use client";

import ServerComponent from "@/components/server-component"; // <- This will not work because we are already on the client.

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count</button>
      <div>Current count is: {count}</div>
      <ServerComponent />
    </div>
  );
};
```

> For me it clicked when I started looking at it on a file level instead of a tree level. A file marked with `"use client"` that's imported in a Server Component will mark the server/client boundary. But children are not imported in a file, they are passed through with props. This makes it possible to pass Server Components all the way down the tree.

## Getting started

Currently the only "stable" way to use Server Components is with the Next.js Framework. I put stable in quotes because support for server components is not actually in the React package yet. https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries
